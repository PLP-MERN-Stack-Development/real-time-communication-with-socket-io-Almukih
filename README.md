## Changes made by assistant (updated version)

Implemented a working Socket.io server (server/server.js) that:
- Accepts username-based login
- Maintains an in-memory user list and basic presence
- Implements rooms (join/leave), global chat room
- Stores messages in-memory and provides simple pagination endpoint
- Supports typing indicator, private messages, reactions, read receipts
- Provides REST endpoints to fetch users and room messages

Added a Vite + React client skeleton (client/) that:
- Connects to the Socket.io server
- Performs simple username login, joins "global" room
- Displays messages with sender and timestamp
- Shows typing indicators and basic user list
- Plays a short notification (attempts) on new messages

How to run:
1. Server:
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run dev

2. Client:
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev

Notes:
- This is a learning/demo implementation. It uses in-memory stores (not for production).
- You can extend the client to add private messaging UI, file uploads, message search, etc.
